## 🚀 Project Overview

The pipeline is a **Python-based architecture** built to retrieve structured data from **multi-site e-commerce and retail platforms**. Its **multi-phase workflow** ensures modularity, adaptability, and scalability.

### Workflow Modules

* **URL Collector (`UrlCollector`)** – Identifies and retrieves product URLs with pagination-aware logic.
* **File Fetcher (`UrlFetcher`)** – Fetches raw HTML pages with request handling, retries, and storage.
* **Data Extractor (`UrlExtractor`)** – Parses attributes with YAML-based extraction rules.
* **Automated File Cleanup (`delete_files_automated.py`)** – Removes redundant/temporary files.
* **Database Management (`database.py`)** – Inserts structured data into **MySQL**.
* **Dashboard Integration (Google Sheets API)** – Uploads extracted CSVs for visualization.

By **decoupling components**, the system allows easy customization for diverse sites, request protocols, and data formats.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Scalability** – Supports concurrent scraping across multiple sources.
* **Configurable Extraction** – YAML-based declarative rules for site-specific data fields.
* **Error Handling & Logging** – Retry logic with JSON-based error logs.
* **Multi-Site Adaptability** – Works with both **API responses** and **HTML parsing**.
* **Data Storage & Transformation** – CSV and MySQL integration for structured persistence.
* **Automated Execution** – Scheduler support for **continuous scraping**.
